Classes:

Car: Represents individual cars. Variables associated with each car
include a license plate number, the number of trips left that the car
wishes to take, the direction that the car is currently in, and a
thread handling the actual driving of the car. To make the car start
its trip, the start method is called. The start method is called with
a reference to the Erie Canal Monitor. The start method then creates a
new thread of the "drive" method, passing to it the Erie Canal Monitor
reference that was passed to it.


Erie Control Monitor: Controls traffic on the bridge. Variables
associated with the bridge include the number of cars currently on the
bridge, and a mutex that controls access to the bridge itself. The
monitor ensures that no collisions will occur between north-bound and
south-bound traffic, and will ensure that only three cars are on the
bridge at a time.


simulation.cpp - The actual executable code of the bridge
simulation. The simulation creates a user-specified number of cars
each taking a user-specified number of trips. It then starts each
car. It is then the responsibility of the car driver to properly use
the Erie Control monitor, to ensure that no crashes occur and that the
bridge always has three or less cars on it at a time.
